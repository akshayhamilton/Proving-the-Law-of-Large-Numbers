# Proving-the-Law-of-Large-Numbers
Testing the law of large numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials 
should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

For our particular case the expected value E(x) is 68.2%.
